# Grocery-Generator

*In very early stages of development (will update this line once a first version is ready)*

You think: "Another grocery list app / recipe app / todo-ish list app?" 
Well yeah, but no. This one will not just show you recipes or just your grocery list based on a recipe. 
This app is meant to make your everyday grocery list making super easy and super quick. 
Once set up and running you can **spend less than a few minutes making up you grocerylist** for the whole week! Or two weeks, or... you get the idea.

This app will automate your Grocery list making. You will add your own recipes and manage them. Not just the special recipes, but the ones you use frequently, on a weekly basis. The ones which will actually make up your weekly grocery list. 
You choose which recipes you'd like to cook this week. A few taps and the app will show what you need to buy. Not only the ingredients for those recipes, other products too. 
It will generate groceries based on your buy behaviour, e.g.: on average you buy toilet paper every 2 weeks --> toilet paper will appear on your grocery list only when you need it. Same with herbs and other products you don't need to buy for every meal/every week.
